    <i></i><b>Gujranwala (Punjabi/Urdu: گوجرانوالہ; pronunciation (help·info)) is a city and capital of Gujranwala Division located in Pakistan. It is also known as "City of Wrestlers" 
    and is quite famous for its food.</b><i>[6] It is the 5th most populous city proper after Karachi,
     Lahore, Faisalabad and Rawalpindi respectively. Founded in the 18th century,
     Gujranwala is a relatively modern town compared to the many nearby millennia-old cities of northern Punjab.
     The city served as the capital of the Sukerchakia Misl state between 1763 and 1799, and is the
     birthplace of the founder of the Sikh Empire, Maharaja Ranjit Singh.</i>
